Tummy Burger is a fun little restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, and then the best part....devour them! (yum)

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
